        <p>It worked.</p> <p>Ice cream streamed out of the plastic bag through the smashed plastic plates and mixed with the rain water on the floor of the street. It flows into a puddle, tainting it white and blue.</p> <p>But the credit card had worked. And the lady hadn't even batted an eye that I'd brought such a credit card from my bag.</p> <p>I wiped my eyes and stood. Turning back as the rain beat down on my coat. My face was wet and the stray strand of dark, nearly auburn hair that I hadn't tucked properly inside the hood of the coat was slicked against my face.</p> <p>Lights in the ice cream shop beckoned me to come and buy some more to replace the one I'd wasted. But I didn't want ice cream anymore.</p> <p>I hadn't lost my cool in a very long time. Much less throw something akin to a tantrum in the middle of the street where everyone could see me and some might even recognize me.</p> <p>My boots squelched with each step I took. If it had a face, its eyes would probably pop out while it belched water, squished by the weight of my shoes.</p> <p>But my shoes are perfectly normal. Unlike me.</p> <p>“You have to accept that she isn't like other children,” my grandma had said to my mother one rainy day when I'd lain on the grass to watch how every drop hit the ground while other children played. It had splashed on my face and when I came back up, my head was a mess of sand, bits of grass and water, and all the children ran from me screaming that I was the monster trying to get them.</p> <p>A normal child would have chased them around as they expected me to, but I'd seen a toad hop past, and I'd tried to catch it just to place it on my head because I thought the sand and grass on my head would be a suitable habitat for the hopping little creature.</p> <p>“A descendant of mine who is definitely more like I am,” Grandma had said that night while I'd sat at the table with my cousins and the rest of the family, picking out the greens from my soup to slurp on them. Her face glowed with pride.</p> <p>Being in the more remote parts of Tokyo like this on a rainy night made me feel as though I could finally breathe and I could finally take in the whole scenery.</p> <p>I could see far ahead of me. The streets were beginning to empty as people filtered into their homes, shops and even into street corners. The high buildings—just like the one her apartment was in—and the strip of two-way roads, an interlocked sidewalk and the semi-darkness that was the natural collaboration of the dark, cloudy sky and the dimly glowing lamps lining the road. Puddles sat in slight depressions while water flowed through the covers of sewers in a satisfying rush.</p> <p>I felt so small, but still so powerful as the street emptied. A sojourner in a world I rarely experienced. A quiet downtown Tokyo had to be another world.</p> <p>My hands were tucked inside my coat while I walked with my knapsack hanging from my shoulder.</p> <p>I should have gotten more ice cream. Shouldn't have smashed the one I had. Mere minutes ago, I was against the idea of getting any more ice cream. But now, I craved chocolate again. The credit card was still in my bag. I could decide to turn around and return to the shop to buy myself some more ice cream, but I kept walking ahead. There was no use for it now, was there? And what if the credit card didn't work?</p> <p>The peaceful shower intensified and the sheets of slanted rain pouring like seeds from the sky was simply a work of art against the extra street lights turned on.</p> <p>I paused and looked around myself, drawing a deep breath into my lungs.</p> <p>“I love the smell of rain,” I said to the empty streets and continued walking.</p> <p>I felt a strange peace. Now, the creepy man taking my pictures didn't existence anymore. I was content except for one thing.</p> <p>Ice cream.</p> <p>I was torn between continuing my journey to nowhere in particular and going back to get more ice cream before heading back to my apartment.</p> <p>I missed the sound of Mizuki's purr.</p> <p>The rain stopped.</p> <p>It was as though someone turned off the rain the way they would a faucet.</p> <p>I paused and stretched my palm out for stray drops from the sky. I got nothing.</p> <p>“What are you doing here?”</p> <p>Like a switch was flipped, the rain poured harder from the sky, bearing down on me so fiercely that I began to feel it soak past the coat I had on.</p> <p>A whoosh of wind. The crack of a whip.</p> <p>I jumped and looked around.</p> <p>“It's too late to be scared,” the warm voice echoed from the space between two buildings.</p> <p>Followed by the silhouette of a lithe looking young woman were echoes of her footsteps from alleys down the road.</p> <p>I gasped and took a few steps back when she came under the faint night light.</p> <p>“I don't plan to take pictures of you,” she said in an amused voice. “But I see you've used the card.”</p> <p>I didn't respond. If she knew about the card, then she must have been watching me. I hadn't even had an inkling that eyes had been on me.</p> <p>“Where are you going?" Your apartment's that way,” she pointed one sharp nail in the opposite direction with a drawl in her voice.</p> <p>“I—”</p> <p>“Yes, taking a walk. I can see that.” She stretched her hand out in the large space between us. “Let me see it.”</p> <p>“See what?”</p> <p>“The card, you retard.”</p> <p>Everyone seemed convinced that I was some sort of idiot. The creepy man who took my pictures. Now she.</p> <p>Maybe I was. Because I was walking towards her with the card in my hand, closing the space between us and placing the card in her hand.</p> <p>She smirked.</p> <p>A flash of light traveled through the card and she held it between her forefinger and middle finger.</p> <p>“Come on,” she gestured to me to take the card from her.</p> <p>I pinched the card and she released it. It was like the exchange between a scared child, buying something fascinating for the first time, and a cocky adult.</p> <p>“That was too easy.”</p> <p>She laughed and suddenly, she was gone. Just disappeared.</p> <p>I realized that the rain has never stopped falling, but the drops had stilled, accumulating in the air like frozen bubbles.</p> <p>The moment she left, everything fell, bathing me and splashing on the road. The pour continued.</p> <p>All I could think of was going to the mall with the card in hand. I had so many things to buy.</p>
