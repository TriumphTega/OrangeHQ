        <p><b>Seeing the world through your mind is living like no one else.</b></p>
        <p>When one cold summer in the innards of a Tokyo she'd never seen before a wind rose and her hair blew in a magnificent flutter, and magic became a thing, Netty's heart was clenched like an eagle in a pigeon cage. And forever, she's searched for that cold summer's day. Forever.</p>
        <p><i>Until forever fades...</i></p>
        <p><i>Into chaos!</i></p>
        <p>Every dark alley promises an omen that her grandma would fetishize were she not clutched in the stinging grips of the shallow beyonds-a place Netty knows not of its existence, a place where life continued like the train, Legacy.</p>
        <p>Her mane is a pride buffering the secrets, padding their leakages, that her soul contains.</p>
        <p>To these secrets, Netty is the coin-less beggar on a busy evening whose bowl is yet to be enlightened with what she doesn't know lives within her.</p>
        <p>Until a stranger drops a coin... And the wind returns.</p>
        <p>The wind returns...<b>Magic! Netty!</b>
        <p>She pants and runs some more. <b>Netty!</b></p>
        <p><b>Netty becomes a traverser in a place where every turn is an electric fence. Still, every turn is a school. Netty is a hapless mouse caught in a house. Every turn is this slap of a lemon inside her cheeks.  Every turn is the fresh offering of steaming pastry on a winter morning. Winters in Tokyo. </b></p>
        <p> Netty remembers...</p>
        <p><i>When the eyes can't see and the ears go deaf, you will be the speeding man on a busy Tokyo way who cannot see what sits right in front of him-a six-eyed pet panting for some love. The innards of Tokyo are your first steps to freedom. But you must see it-her grandma had poked the center of the maturing globes on her chest long ago-where no one else can.</i></p>
        <p><b>See the world through Netty's eyes...</b></p>

        <b><p>Zora Wildfyre</p></b>
        <img src="../../Images/Art/Zora.jpg" width="100%">
        <p>Zora is an adventurous young woman born somewhere deep in Africa, but she's travelled the world-in her mind. She has several unpublished works, of which this is her first attempt at sharing with the whole world.</p>
        <p>Zora likes to try her hand at a bit of everything. Be it horse riding and risking to break her back, or trekking deep into remote forests to find what she's never lost. She has a flair for thinking up worlds beyond imagination. From thinking up sluggish demons hiding in African swamps to the eerie blueblazers zooming the streets of Sapporo.</p>
        <p>Born a lab baby and effectively escaping her teenage years, Zora likes to frequently recount her miscellaneous adventures both inside and outside the lab.</p>
        <p>This is her first book.</p>
