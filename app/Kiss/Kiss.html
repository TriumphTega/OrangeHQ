<i>We've all heard of anime by now. I mean, itâ€™s 2025!</i>
<p>Manga too, if you lean far into that. But that's not exactly what this is about.</p>

<p>It's a thriving culture, with millions upon millions of humans living and existing in the world of books, anime and manga series. People subscribe to the Shonen Jump to read anime, paying for quality content that has changed lives over the years. The same thing with books and webnovels!
It's a beautiful thing, really and we cannot overemphasize the importance of anime & books, this kind of media entertainment and its accompanying subculture to humanity at large.</p>

<p>Yet for all its glory, the sector of entertainment lacks fulfillment in one glaring way; that of giving back to the consumers. Otakus and Weebs, bibliophiles, our kind spend copious amounts of dollars on subscriptions to exclusive manga series, streaming channels for anime and web novel apps where we can't find quality content for free and get no returns except for just personal pleasure.
It shouldn't be so.</p>
<p>If anything, life should be a guaranteed money-back adventure, and with the recent emergence of the wonder of the blockchain world, that ideal is upheld even higher.</p>

<p>The Sempai project is more than just a collection of beautiful, amazing NFT girlfriends and books. We think that this could be the beginning of the revolutionist era in webnovels, manga and book reading/authoring, socializing and onboarding readers and normies onto the blockchain as well as a new overview for decentralized finance (De-Fi) and digital assets.</p>

<p>There is no intention to compete with big dogs like Shonen Jump, but we certainly do hope that we can be blessed with a collaboration, at some distant point in our journey.</p>

</p>Here at Sempai, I seek to, banking heavily on the friendly and easy to use blockchain and innovative DAPP feature, create a user-based and prioritized model of reading to earn that will revolve around the use of NFTs, beautiful artwork and amazing storylines, as well as the blockchain (Solana) and a reward system for spending all in an ecosystem that will remain self-sustainable for as long as the blockchain exists. Forever.</p>

<div class="Whitepaper">
    <h1>Structural Model</h1>
<i>(Foundation First Method)</i>

<p>The Read to Earn (R2E) model will be built upon from scratch with the most meticulous care, knowing that we build to stand moments of impact too. We're expecting quite a crowd in here. When things get kickin!</p>
<p>To facilitate the building of this grand undertaking, we will be offering a grand total of 4 initial Goddess Waifu NFTs, never to be minted or created again, which will grant the early hodlers of the girlfriends, benefits and governance rights in the ecosystem.
These four, along with 1 held by the founding team, will form the Goddess DAO. Holders of these NFTs will hold the Goddess-Consort role.</p>

<i><b>Waifu Lore</b></i>
<br><br>
<i>The Goddess Waifus were the first of their kind, created by Ameteratsu as she smiled down upon the Otakus of this world, who have stayed true to the love for anime and otaku culture that eternally lives in their heart.</i>


<p>Each owner of any waifu girlfriend will have special access to unreleased manga panels by recruited artistes, access to incubated webnovels and author previews and sneak peeks of incoming designs as well as the right to vote in certain special events.</p>

<p>Levels of access and perks will be decided based on entry level. Initial Godess-Consorts will also be privileged to beta test all developed functions in the Dapp and eventual games we build. It is our intention to become the gift that keeps giving when you take this leap of faith with us.</p>

<p>A token is a must, and will be created for use in the ecosystem, with utility ranging from subscription in the Kapp to buying manga-related merch, NFTs and in-Game tokens amongst others. These will be highlighted and broken down into layman terms in the tokenomics document you can access just down below.</p>

<h1><b>Auction Details</b></h1>

<p>The auction will hold at very close to launch, but will not be a part of what makes us function. Instead, this will be an occasion to mark your leap of faith with us, as we cling to the hope that Cryptocurrency and the blockchain, through the platform provided by you, will continue to provide for, and impact the lives of those who have bleak prospects for financial freedom.

We aim to be completely immersive, and members of the community will get to participate in the project beyond their wildest dreams, and will have a say in all that will be done, from the moment the first auctions are completed, including the decisions to mint a newer tier for funding of sub-projects decided upon by the Goddess DAO.</P>

<p>An important thing to note is that each of the four Goddess Tier Waifus, alongside the one held by the founder team, will represent 20% ownership of the total DAO League and will come with the requisite legal rights in real life.</p>

<p>This means that to keep it as fair as possible, the original 4 NFTs will be held by the DAO in escrow and revenue will be distributed to every stakeholder (you) based on your contribution during the auction.</p> 

<p>How these funds will be used to continue building our home, (Yes. If you read up to here, it's ours now) is up to you.</p>

<h1><i>How does this help you?</i></h1>

<p>Simple. Wen come time, you can have your voice count</p>. 

<p>Please remember that not all users will ever be able to get into the Dao even though we will keep them open for at least one full calendar year, and this first auction will end in a round of NFT and Token airdrops, also granting additional lifelong benefits tied to not just yourDapp wallet, but your person.</p>

<h1><i>What sets us apart?</i></h1>

<p>We will be tapping into an already established ecosystem, one with unrivalled potential for growth. </p>

    <h1>From Us To You</h1>
    
    <p>We can't do this without you. So, as long as you see a possibility in this humble pitch, a home for yourself or a kid near you, then please join hands with us. </p>
    
    <p>It takes just one match to start a forest fire. You know that, right?
