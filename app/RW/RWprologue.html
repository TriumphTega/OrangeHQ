    <p>Deep in the depths of Ami, the Volca stirred.</p> 
    <p><i>Something was wrong.</i></p>
    <p>There were vibrations in the earth that affected its gorging. Blind from years spent here and engorged on the copious amounts of idan that this volcanic region produced millenia after millenia, it had grown almost half as big as the underwater mountain that gave it sustenance itself.</p> 
    <p><i>Perhaps it was time to leave.</i> It would seek cleaner waters and find out from its brethren, the other keepers. That there was something in the waters, there was no doubt of. Maybe they would have the answer that it sought.</p>
    <p>The call had begun again. This time though, there was something distinctly different about it. It felt new, and yet it felt like home. More importantly, it felt like that idan, the one that had swept waves across the ocean's floors.</p>

    <i>Yes, it was very much like it, even if it was fundamentally different too. </i>

    <p>Volca sent a pulse through the Ami, the show waves echoing with a distant and yet silent boom. 
        His kind, they would begin to find him. It was time to prepare for yet another dance.</p>

    <p>Whether big or small, the Ami needed its denizens to stand to attention.</p> 

    <p>There was time. More than enough.</p> 

    <p><i>At least, the Volca hoped that it was so.</i></p>
