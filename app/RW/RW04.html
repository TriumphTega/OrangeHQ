    <p>There's a story to be told about it came to be, that a royal family had become forced to become desperate enough, that they agreed to settle all accords and become one.

But this was done only after the most horrible defeat that could have ever been suffered.</p>

<p>The Rumi family had been destroyed by pride. Pride and vices had ruled too long in the heart of the royal family and when the fall of the kingdom came at war, it wasn't with much pain that the citizens of the provinces and kingdoms received new rulership.

But the family was also the ideal for the Uwa people. And so they couldn't be touched. Just banished to the island where an eye could be kept on them, whisking away bright and promising talents to serve in the new Xali-controlled imperial army.

The Xalians had attacked out of nowhere. </p>

<p>From across the sea, many had said even though no one knew the true history of their arrival here. Except that for all their numbers and might, they were simply on an expedition to find a better place to live, when they chanced upon the continent of Uwa.

Now, the hundred year Dread Wars were a vital part of the continents history, but nobody liked to talk about it. Certainly not the Uwans who were children of, and even direct participants in the battles that had spread like wildfire for the supremacy in the land.

Unfortunately, the Uwans had lost, and now lived as second class citizens nearly everywhere you went on the continent. Except for the Islands.

Those had been a fortress unassailable, by virtue of being commanded by the greatest of Rumi sons, Alkemi Rumi.</p>

<p>The man had kept the entirety of the royal family safe for over a decade, toward the closing of the war, all due to his powers that gave him command over the seas.
Coupled with his wife's earthen bloodline powers, the two had been a much pointy rock in the Xali side's hands, without so much as a grip being found.

It made the ensuing surrender that much more painful for Uwans, and the continuity of the royal lines a sore in the heart of every single citizen.

And so, the peace has been restored. </p>

<p>And the two of their greatest heroes, taken across the sea to probably never return.</p>

<p>Denn continued to hobble over the sand, his thoughts keeping him from realizng he was already in the pits from his subconscious walking.</p>

<p>It wasn't a until a whiz of bright light flashed dangerously close to his face that he jerked back, finally aware of where he was.</p>

<p>"Oh you. Walking into the pits without your big shield. Who's going to protect you?"</p>

<p>The snarky voice of his greatest torment rang out across the wide open arena.</p>
