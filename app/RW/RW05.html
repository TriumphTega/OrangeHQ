    <p>Jared, unlike Denn, was a fine representation of what the Rumi bloodline looked like.</p>

<p>Tall, with dark wavy hair and the sea-green eyes that was characteristic of their family's children, the boy stood at just over six feet, compared to Denn's scrawny little shape.</p>

<p>And for all of his height and heft, not one single inch of the bigger boy was a soft spot for the smaller one.
Denn did not know why, but Jared absolutely hated his very existence. Facing him on the sands was always a nightmare, because he never pulled his blows, or went easy when using his powers.</p>

<p>The view from deep within the pits covered the ocean, because the width of the fighting arenas could be said to rather fit the pits being called the caverns.</p>

<p>The walls had the usual jaunts were people in the droves came to watch. 

And with the ocean sparkling a green hue beyond them was spectacular as always; the setting sun liked to bath everything in a warm, and ethereal orange glow.</p>

<p>This was a place called Orange.</p>

<p>A few of the returning fishing vessels were silhouetted against the glittering water, making their way tranquilly into harbor at the end of a long day.</p>

<p>And yet. This was the time the ilumi beat their drums.</p>

<p>Perhaps it was the way the water possessed a heat in this time, but the people's prayers included flocking to the vast piers that stood for the docks, to drink their fill of the luminous looking water. Everyday.</p>
